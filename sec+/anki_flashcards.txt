Personally identifiable information (PII); Information used to infer and individual's identity.

Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII); Specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guideliness, such as passwords, e-mail, etc.

Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI); A technique that manipulates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently.

Business Email Compromise (BEC); A type of phishing attack where a threat actor impersonates a known source to obtain financial advantage.

CISSP; Certified Information Systems Security Professional is a globally recognized and highly sought-after information security certification, awarded by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium

Computer virus; Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.

Cryptographic attack; An attack that affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient.

Hacker; Any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data.

Malware; Software designed to harm devices or networks.

Password attack; An attempt to access password secured devices, systems, networks, or data.

Phishing; The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

Physical attack; A security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed.

Physical social engineering; An attack in which a threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Social engineering; A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

Social media phishing; A type of attack where a threat actor collects detailed information about their target on social media sites before initiating the attack.

Spear phishing; A malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source.

Supply-chain attack; An attack that targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed.

USB baiting; An attack in which a threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install to unknowingly infect a network.

Virus; refer to “computer virus”

Vishing; The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

Watering hole attack ; A type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users

Firewall; It controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It is usually set up to filter traffic such as unauthorized access, malicious activity and DoS attacks with a set of rules that the network admin chose.  On Linux it is usually set up by using the software `iptables`.

Proxy; It is a software that functions as an intermediary between an client and a server. The requests the client makes can be modified by the proxy before being sent to the server. And the outcoming responses can be filtered by the proxy. In short, proxies intercept incoming and outgoing HTTP requests between a client and a server.

Active Directory; It is a Microsoft service that functions as a database to manage network resources within an organization, such as users, computers, printers, and other network devices.

SIEM; It stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a system that involves collection and analysis of security events and data from various sources within an organization's environment.  SIEM software provide monitoring, detection, and response capabilities to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats and incidents. The most popular SIEM software is `splunk`.

IDPS; Intrusion Detection and Prevention System. It monitors the network and system for malicious activity or policy violations and takes action to prevent or mitigate potential security incidents. The most popular IDPS software is `snort`.

Security frameworks; They are sets of guidelines to ensure security best practices and standards.

NIST Identify; understanding and managing cybersecurity risks such as assets, vulnerabilities, threats and potential impacts.

NIST Protect; implementing security measures to protect against attacks. This includes encryption, access controls, security awareness, firewalls, etc.

NIST Detect; this function focuses on implementing systems to monitor and detect unauthorized access, potential threats, cybersecurity breachs, and incident logs. This helps the organization to quickly and efficiently respond to cybersecurity events.

NIST Respond; it orients how to respond to incidents in order to mitigate their impact and return normal operations as quickly as possible.

NIST Recover; it focuses on how to recover from cybersecurity incidents. It includes minimization of financial loss, making post-incident analysis and learn from the mistakes that led to the incident. (Incident Response).
